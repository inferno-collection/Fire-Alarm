# Inferno Collection: Fire Alarm
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Fire-Alarm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/inferno-collection/Fire-Alarm)

__Public Beta Version 4.5__

The Fire Alarm resource adds both fire alarms, manual call-points/pull-stations, and fire control pannels into your server. By default, the resource comes with one location, the Mission Row police station, which contains a handfull of call-points, and a control-panel, however, the resource allows and encourages you to add more, though easy to use JSON files.

The call-points and control panel consist of non-networked objects, with each control panel having an openable NUI. From the NUI, the player has access to menu options; when the fire alarm for that building has been activated, the player has the ability to silence the sounders, and/or reset the alarm for the building.

Presently, the following can be customized:
- Location of manual call-points and control panels.
- Number of call-points per control pannel.
- Per-panel passcodes for each control-panel.
- The area within which the alarm can be heard once sounded.
- [Fire/EMS Pager](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Fire-EMS-Pager) intergration, allowing you to page per-panel tones when an alarm is activated.
